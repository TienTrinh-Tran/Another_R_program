# The purpose of this program
1 - Show the distributions of rating variables from our quote data in the current year compared to previous years.

2 - Compare the distributions from quote data to that in our existing book, also known as Exposure. We would like to see if there are differences in trends across multiple rating elements.

3 - Show the current Loss Ratio by categories within each rating element.

Having all these data visualizations together can help actuaries prioritize their focus on the "most potentially problematic" variables first when making rate changes.
